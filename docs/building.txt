@GROUP Unix-like Systems with GCC (Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X) @END

Building Bam is easy and have very few dependencies. Make sure
that you have GCC and pthreads installed and run this command:

<pre>sh make_unix.sh</pre>

This will build bam with optimizations turned on. If you want a
debug version of bam, you can invoke the script like this:

<pre>sh make_unix.sh -O0 -g</pre>

That will turn off the optimizations and include debug
information in the build.

@GROUP Windows (TODO) @END

<pre>make_win32_msvc2005.bat</pre>
<pre>make_win32_mingw.bat</pre>

@GROUP BeOS and Haiku @END

Building Bam works the same way as on Unix-like systems but
the script is called make_beos.sh instead. You can build Bam
by running:

<pre>sh make_beos.sh</pre>

@GROUP Running the Test Suite @END

Bam comes with a test suite to verify that Bam is working like
it should. The suite requires <a href="http://www.python.com">Python</a>
to be installed. This test suite is used during the development
of Bam to verify that nothing breaks between releases. You
can run the test suite by typing this:

<pre>python test.py</pre>

It will either print out that all tests where successfull or
what tests it didn't pass.
